# Image Noise Reduction using Auto Encoder
## Discription
In this project, a convolutional autoencoder is presented which is trained to denosify images. Model is trained on the actual images and nosiy images and tested with noisy images. 

# Background Detailes
## What is Auto Encoder?
An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, by training the network to ignore signal “noise”

## Data used to train the model
MNIST data is used to train and test the model
